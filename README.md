### Hey, I'm Dhaval
- I enjoy working with machine learning!
- I'm always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills in this field.
- Over the past few years, I have attained a wealth of experience in ML/DL through working on projects as part of the university courses, specializations from Coursera, and research assistantships.
